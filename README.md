## About EVEOnline.ESI

EVEOnline.ESI is a wrapper over the [`ESI API`](https://esi.evetech.net/ui/) based on an middleware approach. The middleware works on the pipline principle in ASP.NET Core and allows you to add/modify the behavior of request generation and response processing.

EVEOnline.ESI includes following default ordered middlewares:

- `ProtectionHandler` - Performs getting the access token from `IAccessTokenProvider`, validates scope, and sets the Authorization header
- `RequestHeadersHandler` - Configures the default headers for the request.
- `UrlRequestParametersHandler` - Prepares a list of parameters to be passed and replaced in the URL template.
- `BodyRequestParametersHandler` - (only for POST & PUT requests) - Prepares the body of the request.
- `EndpointHandler` - Prepares a ready URL for sending the request.
- `ETagHandler` - Used when the setting "UseETag" is enabled. Stores the eTag value for a particular request in internal storage and applies it to the next request.
- `RequestGetHandler` or `RequestPostHandler` or `RequestDeleteHandler` or `RequestPutHandler` - Make a request to API

## Limitations

1. EVEOnline.ESI currently has no built-in functionality to work in EVE SSO. You need to implement your own token provider using the provided interface `IAccessTokenProvider`.
In the future it is planned to write a separate library for ASP.NET Core, which will provide native authorization support.
2. EVEOnline.ESI uses ENDPOINT VERSIONING according to best practices (see [more](https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/article/esi-endpoint-versioning-important-info-and-best-practices)). At the moment there is no way to choose a different route (e.g. legacy/latest or dev) except to override the EndpointHandler in pipline. But in the future, we plan to provide this feature in separate package along with repeat customization. I don't know why it might be necessary :sweat_smile:

## NuGet Packages

| **Package** | **Latest Version** | **About** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `EVEClient.NET` | [![NuGet](https://buildstats.info/nuget/EVEClient.NET)](https://buildstats.info/nuget/EVEClient.NET "Download EVEClient.NET from NuGet.org") | The core functionality to communicate with [`EVE`](https://esi.evetech.net/ui/) API. |
| `EVEClient.NET.Polly` | Coming Soon... | Integration with [`Polly`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly/) APIs to provide a repeat function and selection of alternative routes. |
| `EVEClient.NET.Identity` | Coming Soon... | OAuth 2.0 framework for ASP.NET Core to provide out-of-the-box functionality for EVE SSO authorization. |

## Quick start

To use the library, you need to invoke the extension method for `IServiceCollection`.

<!-- snippet: quick-start -->
```cs
_serviceCollection.AddEVEOnlineEsiClient(config =>
{
    // Required property. Header in your client which includes the source of the request and contact information.
    // This way, CCP can identify and help you with issues if youâ€™re banned.
    config.UserAgent = "agent name";
    // If you want to use the eTag functionality for less ESI API server load.
    // 304 http status code will be returned on a second request as long as the data on the server is cached and has not been changed 
    config.EnableETag = true; // 
})
.UseAccessTokenProvider<YourAccessTokenProvider>();
```
